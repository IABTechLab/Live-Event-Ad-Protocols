# Live Event Ad Protocols

This repository contains specifications and implementation guidance for the IAB Tech Lab Live Event Ad Playbook (LEAP).

LEAP provides technical protocols intended to help advertising systems prepare for, transact against, and optimize monetization of live event advertising supply. The current repository includes specifications for pre-event forecasting and near-real-time concurrent stream signals, along with implementation guidance for using those APIs independently and together.

## Repository Contents

### API Specifications

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`Forecast_API.md`](Forecast_API.md) | Defines the Forecast API, which enables authorized partners to retrieve information about future live event advertising supply, including event schedules, expected audience scale, and expected ad inventory. |
| [`Concurrent_Streams_API.md`](Concurrent_Streams_API.md) | Defines the Concurrent Streams API, which enables authorized subscribers to retrieve near-real-time stream-count information while live events are occurring. |

### Implementation Guidance

Implementation guidance is maintained in the [`implementation-guidance`](implementation-guidance/) directory.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`Common_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Common_API_Guidance.md) | Defines common API conventions that apply across LEAP APIs unless an API-specific guide states otherwise. |
| [`Forecast_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Forecast_API_Guidance.md) | Provides implementation guidance specific to the Forecast API. |
| [`Concurrent_Streams_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Concurrent_Streams_API_Guidance.md) | Provides implementation guidance specific to the Concurrent Streams API. |
| [`Multiple_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Multiple_API_Guidance.md) | Explains how the Forecast API and Concurrent Streams API can be used together across the live event monetization lifecycle. |

## How the APIs Work Together

The Forecast API and Concurrent Streams API address different phases of live event advertising.

```text
Forecast API              -> pre-event planning
Concurrent Streams API    -> live-event adjustment
```

### Forecast API

The Forecast API is intended for use before a live event begins.

It helps advertising systems:

- discover future live events
- estimate audience scale before the event
- estimate advertising inventory availability
- support infrastructure planning
- inform deal planning and packaging
- support campaign planning before the event begins

Once an event begins, the Forecast API should not be treated as the authoritative signal for current live concurrency.

### Concurrent Streams API

The Concurrent Streams API is intended for use while a live event is occurring.

It helps advertising systems:

- understand current live audience scale
- prepare for and respond to QPS spikes
- scale regional infrastructure
- adjust bidding and pacing behavior
- reduce latency, slate, and lost monetization opportunities

During a live event, Concurrent Streams API data should be treated as the more relevant operational signal for current stream counts.

## Recommended Reading Order

### Implementing the Forecast API

1. [`Common_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Common_API_Guidance.md)
2. [`Forecast_API.md`](Forecast_API.md)
3. [`Forecast_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Forecast_API_Guidance.md)

### Implementing the Concurrent Streams API

1. [`Common_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Common_API_Guidance.md)
2. [`Concurrent_Streams_API.md`](Concurrent_Streams_API.md)
3. [`Concurrent_Streams_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Concurrent_Streams_API_Guidance.md)

### Implementing Both APIs Together

1. [`Common_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Common_API_Guidance.md)
2. [`Forecast_API.md`](Forecast_API.md)
3. [`Concurrent_Streams_API.md`](Concurrent_Streams_API.md)
4. [`Forecast_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Forecast_API_Guidance.md)
5. [`Concurrent_Streams_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Concurrent_Streams_API_Guidance.md)
6. [`Multiple_API_Guidance.md`](implementation-guidance/Multiple_API_Guidance.md)

## Guidance vs. Specification

The API specifications define the objects, fields, and values for each API.

The implementation guidance documents explain recommended implementation patterns, operational considerations, and API usage workflows.

If implementation guidance conflicts with an API specification, the API specification is the source of truth.

If common implementation guidance conflicts with API-specific guidance, the API-specific guidance applies for that API.

## Cross-API Identity Correlation

Implementers using more than one LEAP API should preserve stable identifiers that allow the same live event to be correlated across planning, live adjustment, bidding, and reporting workflows.

Recommended identifiers include:

- `content.id`
- `content.data.cids`
- Forecast API event-level `id`
- event timing and stable content metadata as a fallback

Where possible, identifiers used in LEAP APIs should also align with identifiers used in downstream OpenRTB bid requests and reporting systems.
