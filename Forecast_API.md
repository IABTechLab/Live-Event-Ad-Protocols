# Forecast API

## Executive Summary

Today’s programmatic systems lack standardized mechanisms for surfacing future live event supply, limiting buyers’ ability to plan and reserve inventory in advance. To address this, we propose an API that enables broadcasters and content owners to publish structured metadata—such as event schedules, expected ad breaks, and audience forecasts—to exchanges and DSPs. Using a shared identifier and a schema aligned with OpenRTB and AdCOM standards, this API will make upcoming inventory discoverable and actionable, enabling a scalable advance market for live streaming advertising.

## Introduction and Background <a name="intro"></a>

We want to enable both a “spot” market for streaming live events, as well as an “advance” market. In order to enable an advance market, buyers need to become aware of upcoming supply including but not limited to live events that will be available at some future point. To enable that, sellers must be able to notify buyers that a given program will be streamed, with anticipated parameters including start/end time, expected streams, and expected inventory configuration.

The proposed approach is to standardize a messaging format for syncing a Live Events Manifest, with a common identifier for any given event, which buyers and sellers can use to communicate about it. Broadcasters/streamers might push their manifest into the exchanges that are authorized to sell this supply via this API. Exchanges might subsequently push these manifests into their integrated DSPs (or perhaps broadcasters/streamers would do it) using the same standardized API.

### Goals <a name="goals"></a>

- Forecast is shared to facilitate pre-planning of both “spot” market and “advance”.

### Non Goals

- Realtime scaling use cases that require Real Time Active user volume estimates are covered under “Concurrent Streams API” scope.
- While meant to help inform what content goes into a given deal negotiation, the specifics of those deals should be communicated through the Deal API.

## In Scope <a name="scope"></a>

- This API addresses only future events. Once the start time happens, this API should not be used for that event.
- Ensure advertising systems and partners in the monetization supply chain have concurrency estimates that reflect expected traffic volume of upcoming events so they can plan infrastructure scaling to manage incoming QPS spikes for upcoming events.
- Provide information to help inform deal negotiations.

## Out of Scope

It is assumed that Inventory Owners standing up this endpoint will create a security model to ensure information is only available to parties where there is an existing agreement. The authentication protocol is left to the discretion of the event creator, and should be discussed with API users a priori.

## Implementation Guidance <a name="impguidance"></a>

### Getting Started

1. Forecast Data Provider (typically a Content Owner, Streamer, MVPD, or Distributor) will stand up a Forecasting API endpoint with information about upcoming events contained in this API.
2. Forecast Data Provider informs partners that the API endpoint is available.
3. Forecast Data Provider provisions partner(s) to call the endpoint with some cadence based on the permissions that have been given the partner.
4. Partner (typically a monetization partner, such as an ad exchange or DSP) stands up a mechanism to call API and consume information about upcoming events.

### General guidance

- Values are likely to change over time as the event gets closer. Farther-out events will have more approximate viewership estimations, but it is still helpful to send an expected viewership range with the understanding that forecasts will become more accurate over time.
- Some event metadata may be omitted based on real-time conditions. For example, a post-season game will not be determined until very close to the event because the teams cannot be known.

## Uncertainty <a name="uncertainty"></a>

Because this API deals with things happening in the future, a change in values should be expected. They fall into two main categories: if an event will happen (see Using tentative vs. scheduled) and if the timing of the ad breaks are known prior to the event (see Planned vs. Unplanned Ad Inventory).

### Using Tentative vs Scheduled

It is possible that the event itself may not happen and should be flagged as tentative. For example, a game series of 7 games that was won in 5—games 6 and 7 will not be played.

### Static vs Variable Ad Inventory

The `unplanned` attribute in the Ad Inventory Configuration object signals whether an event may contain commercial breaks that are not fully known or scheduled in advance at the time the forecast is published.

This field is intended to help downstream systems distinguish between:

- **Planned:** inventory where the ad breaks are known beforehand and fixed
- **Unplanned:** inventory whose timing, frequency, or existence depends on real-time event conditions

#### When to Set `unplanned = 1` (Yes)

When any material portion of the event’s ad inventory is expected to be triggered dynamically or conditionally, including but not limited to:

- Game-state-driven breaks (live sports where breaks are inserted based on gameplay rather than a fixed rundown)
- Series-based or conditional events (events that may not occur depending on prior outcomes)
- Live events with elastic ad load (total ad load expands or contracts based on pacing/duration/retention)
- Dynamic pod construction (variable pod durations, variable slot counts, breaks skipped or consolidated)

#### When to Set `unplanned = 0` (No)

When all commercial breaks are pre-defined and expected to occur as scheduled such as:

- Award shows with scripted act breaks
- Season premieres with fixed pod patterns
- Pre-recorded content
- Live events where ad breaks are contractually fixed (e.g., halftime-only sponsorships)

#### Mixed Inventory Scenarios (Important)

Many live events contain both planned and unplanned inventory. Recommended practices include:

- Set `unplanned = 1` if any unplanned breaks exist
- Use optional extensions (e.g., `podpattern`) to describe known, fixed pods
- Treat remaining inventory as probabilistic or opportunistic

#### Seller Interpretation Guidance

- Avoid selling guaranteed pod positions within unplanned inventory unless risk is explicitly managed
- Use conservative assumptions for advance deals
- Reserve unplanned inventory for impression-based buying, programmatic auctions, and outcome-based guarantees

#### Buyer Interpretation Guidance

- Treat `unplanned = 1` as a signal of forecast uncertainty
- Expect inventory delivery to be non-uniform and potentially front- or back-loaded
- Plan for dynamic pacing and potential makegoods
